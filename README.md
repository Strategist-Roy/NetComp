## DisSort
DisSort aims to tackle the problem of sorting of very large input files, that might take up a lot of time and memory for a single system. But distributing the task of sorting over a network of systems, we reduce the time complexity of out task to <br> **(n/p)log(n/p)** where n is the size of input, and p is the number of dedicated systems used to compute.<br />
       Yay!!,,,Now you can sort huge set of numbers at ease if you exploit the capabilities of a distributed system.
